This project is a simple website, 
linked together using relative links for both the other pages on the website (the other recipes) 
and the images being used. Various ordered and unordered lists display the ingridients througout the website
 and the steps to follow. My first practice using a github repository and learning how to use git in order to manage various files, folders and directories on my computer.
